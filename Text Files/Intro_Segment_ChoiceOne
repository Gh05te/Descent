You grab your jacket and head out to the street. 

Your eyes wander around in the darkness, and a chill as cold as steel wraps 
itself around you, causing the hairs on the back of your neck to stand on end. 
A single street light flickers with a yellowed glow. Your whole body shakes 
as you turn back around to see two black shapes scurry across your front lawn. 
At first, you think it must have been a trick of the light. 

A cat leaps out from the fence on the side of the house. One of the shapes freezes 
in place. Its frame lowers slowly to the ground and centers on its prey. You can 
hear a strange, faint clicking sound emanating from the shape. 

     The cat attempts to jump back over the fence and before it can even attempt 
to scurry up the side, it is pulled in half by the creature. After its prey is 
consumed, the obsidian shape appears to be searching for more food. This thing 
must be hungry. You look at your car. It's a bit of a sprint but you think you 
can make it. Your door isn't that far away either. 

Will you try to make it to your [c]ar or [d]oor?
